## 🎯 Introduction

This repository contains the official implementation of our **IROS 2025** paper:

> **"Towards Robust Sensor-Fusion Ground SLAM: A Comprehensive Benchmark and a Resilient Framework"**

In this work, we propose a complete solution for robust SLAM on ground robots operating under degraded conditions. Our key contributions are:

- 📦 **[M3DGR Benchmark](https://github.com/sjtuyinjie/M3DGR)**: A comprehensive multi-sensor, multi-scenario SLAM benchmark for evaluating performance in challenging environments.  
- 🚀 **Ground-Fusion++ (this repo)**: A resilient and modular SLAM framework integrating heterogeneous sensors for robust localization and high-quality mapping.

---

## 🔧 Key Features

- **Multi-sensor Integration:** GNSS, RGB-D camera, IMU, wheel odometer, and LiDAR.  
- **Robustness:** Combines state-of-the-art SLAM components to ensure accurate localization and mapping in large-scale, real-world scenarios.  
- **Modularity:** Designed as an extensible baseline to support future research and practical deployments in complex environments.
