# Ground-Fusion2
Ground-Fusion++: 
A resilient modular SLAM framework named Ground-Fusion++, which integrates GNSS, RGB-D camera, IMU, wheel odometer and LiDAR. **Rather than focusing on theoretical innovations, this system is designed to achieve robust localization and high-quality mapping in large-scale environments**. By establishing a strong and adaptable baseline, Ground-Fusion++ serves as a solid foundation for future research and real-world applications.

**This paper is under review now. Full datasets and codes will be released once upon paper acceptance.**
