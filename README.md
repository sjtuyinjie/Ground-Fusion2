## 🎯 Introduction
This is the official implementation of the IROS2025 paper entitled "Towards Robust Sensor-Fusion Ground SLAM: A Comprehensive Benchmark and A Resilient Framework". This paper presents a complete solution to robust SLAM for ground robots under degraded environments, including a comprehensive benchmark M3DGR([Link](https://github.com/sjtuyinjie/M3DGR)) and a resilient SLAM framework Ground-Fusion++(this repo).
Ground-Fusion++ is a resilient modular SLAM framework, which integrates GNSS, RGB-D camera, IMU, wheel odometer and LiDAR. **Our system focusing on combining existing cutting-edge methods to achieve robust localization and high-quality mapping in large-scale environments**. By establishing a strong and adaptable baseline, Ground-Fusion++ serves as a solid foundation for future research and real-world applications.
