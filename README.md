## 🎯 Introduction
This is the official implementation of the IROS2025 paper entitled "Towards Robust Sensor-Fusion Ground SLAM: A Comprehensive Benchmark and A Resilient Framework".
Ground-Fusion++ is a resilient modular SLAM framework, which integrates GNSS, RGB-D camera, IMU, wheel odometer and LiDAR. **Rather than focusing on theoretical innovations, this system combines existing cutting-edge methods to achieve robust localization and high-quality mapping in large-scale environments**. By establishing a strong and adaptable baseline, Ground-Fusion++ serves as a solid foundation for future research and real-world applications.
