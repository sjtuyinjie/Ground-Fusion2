# Ground-Fusion2
Ground-Fusion++: 
A resilient modular SLAM framework named Ground-Fusion++, which integrates GNSS, RGB-D camera, IMU, wheel odometer and LiDAR. This system achieves robust localization and promising mapping in large-scale environments, establishing a strong and adaptable baseline for future research.

This paper is under review now. Full datasets and codes will be released once upon paper acceptance.
